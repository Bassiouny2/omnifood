Welcome to Omnifood - Your AI-driven solution for a healthy and convenient diet!

## About Omnifood

Omnifood is a technology company with a primary focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. We recognize that people lead busy lives, often leaving little time for cooking, which can result in poor dietary choices and long-term health consequences. Our solution employs an AI-centric approach to address this issue. Users can use our app to specify their dietary preferences, likes, and dislikes. Our AI algorithm then creates a personalized and unique weekly meal plan. But that's not all â€“ we collaborate with restaurants and cooking partners to prepare and deliver all meals from the generated plans, available in selected cities. All of this is conveniently packaged into a monthly subscription, allowing users to choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every day of the month.
